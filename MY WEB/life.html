          <h1>Lorem ipsum</h1>
          <p>During feudal Japan there was constant warefare between the Daimyo
          of lands. As there was many shogunates across Japan there was a real thirst for power
        between rival Daimyo & Shoguns respectively. Hence, many Allies were formed
      and broken during this period, and <b>A LOT</b> of back stabbing in order to obtain power.
      <br><br>
      however one thing for certain is that honour was a major part of Japan throughout all classes of
      the hierarchy, especially amongst the rulling class: Shogun, Daimyo, and Samurai.
      <br><br>
      In Medieval Japan, rice was the staple nourishment of their eating regimen. Cooked or
      salted vegetables were straightforward nourishments for the customary individuals.
      Then again, fish and other fish were utilized in going with dishes for rich families. Noodles got
      well known in the fourteenth - fifteenth hundreds of years. There was no huge - scale
      cultivating of animals, so the meat was not generally eaten. Fish was eaten crisp if
      conceivable and frequently crude. Sushi started it's a method for protecting fish by salting
      it and afterward folding it over bubbled rice.

      <br><br>
      Regular daily existence for medieval Japanese kids was genuinely basic. Youngsters were not required
      to accept their predetermined job until it came time for their future. Contingent upon what
       position kids were naturally introduced to chose at what age they started working and
       forming further into their future. The sex of kids likewise
       affected how knowledgeable they became & the conduct shifted from their situations
       in the social chain of command. Young men were profoundly regarded while young ladies
       were viewed as mediocre compared to men, their principle design was to get pregnant and ideally bear a son.
