            <h1>How did Feudalism begin?</h1>
            <p>From the earliest starting point of Japanese human advancement
               until 1185 an Emperor managed the entirety of Japan. An Emperor
               is like a King, he was also seen as a religious leader. Be that
               as it may, the Emperor started to lose power in a progression of
                wars. A civil war broke out in 1336 that ended any significant
                 power of the Emperor had. The Emperor sent armies of what got known
                  as samurai to battle the civil war for him, what's more, when
                  they returned he gave the title Shogun to the military leader,
                  so they would not take him over as Emperor.</p>

          <article class="whatis-text-2">

            <h1>Feudalism?</h1>
            <p>Feudalism is a sort of government where frail sovereignties
              (Emperor) attempts to control a territory of land through agreements
               with well off landholders. Feudalism led progressions in Japan.
               The primitive time of Japanese history was when powerful lords/Daimyo
                and the military intensity of Warlords (Shogun), and their warriors,
                the Samurai controlled Japan. <br><br>

                So, well and truly, the result of the civil wars led to the Emperor
                of Japan becoming very weak and incapable of obtaining power to command his territory,
                which meant the SHOGUN truly rules Japan.<br><br>

                and it can be seen how fragmented the lands were. </p>

            <p>Starting off the hierarchy is the Shōgun.<br><br>
              The Shōgun was the military dictator of Japan during a large
               portion of the period spreading over from 1185 to 1868.
               Shōguns were typically the accepted leaders of the nation,
               however, Shōgun is traditionally chosen by the emperor.<br><br>
               The dictator of Japanese society created a circumstance in which
               control of the military got control of the nation, and the emperor
               stayed in his royal residence in Kyōto mostly as an image of power
               behind the Shōgun.

              The Daimyō were powerful feudal rulers in Feudal Japan. Japan was

              class that rose to control in the twelfth century and commanded the
              Japanese government. The Samurai made up the military of Japan,
